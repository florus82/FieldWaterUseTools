# Welcome to SL2P-FORCE
Link to original python implementation: https://github.com/djamainajib/SL2P-PYTHON

SL2P-FORCE is a python implementation of the Simplified Level 2 Product Prototype Processor (SL2P) described in [Weiss and Baret (2016)](https://step.esa.int/docs/extra/ATBD_S2ToolBox_L2B_V1.1.pdf). It corresponds to the algorithm implemented in the [LEAf-Toolbox](https://github.com/rfernand387/LEAF-Toolbox) that corrects for bugs in the implemention of SL2P within the European Space Agency Sentinel 2 Toolbox as documented in [Fernandes et al. 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723001517?via%3Dihub).

SL2P-FORCE is designed to estimate vegetation biophysical variables (Table 1) at 10 or 20 meters spatial resolution from Sentinel-2 FORCE Tiles. 

Required inputs
---------------
-	Sentinel 2 FORCE Tile (Single TIF with needed bands or multiple TIFs for each band)
-	The needed vegetation variable (Table 1)
-	The needed spatial resolution: 10m or 20m (depending on input and desired output)
Outputs
-------
SL2P-FORCE is designed to estimate five vegetation variables (Table 1). 

Products are composed of 4-layers and exported in GeoTIFF format (Table 2).

|Vegetation variable	|Description	|Unit	|Nominal variation range|
|---------------------|-------------|:-----:|:-----------------------:|
|LAI	|Half the total green foliage area per horizontal ground area.	|$m^{2} / m^{2}$ |0 - 8|
|fCOVER	|Fraction of nadir canopy cover	|Ratio	|0 – 1|
|fAPAR	|Fraction of absorbed clear sky PAR at 10:30 am local time	|Ratio	|0 – 1|
|CCC	|Canopy chlorophyll A+B content	|$g / m^{2}$	|0 - 600|
|CWC	|Canopy water content	|$g / m^{2}$	|0 – 1|
|Albedo	|Black sky shortwave albedo at 10:30am local time	|Ratio	|0 – 0.2|

|SL2P input flag (Quality Code)	               |0: Valid, 1: SL2P input out of SL2P calibration domain     |
|SL2P output flag (Quality Code)               |	0: Valid, 1: estimates out of the nominal variation range|
